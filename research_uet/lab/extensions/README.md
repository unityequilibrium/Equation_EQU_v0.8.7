## 🌟 Highlights

### 1. The "Higgs" Moment (Mexican Hat)
We found that when Information Density ($I$) interacts with the field, it creates a "Sombrero Potential" naturally.
*   **Meaning:** Mass is not fundamental; it's a result of symmetry breaking in the Information Field.

### 2. Why $c$ is Finite (Lorentz Memory)
We verified that "instant action" is impossible in UET.
*   **Mechanism:** The "Memory Kernel" (History) acts as a drag force.
*   **Result:** Information cannot travel faster than the system can update its own memory. This *is* the speed of light.
