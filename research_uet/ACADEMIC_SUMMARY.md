# 🎓 UET Academic Summary

> *For researchers, educators, and anyone who wants to understand and use UET*

## 1. What is UET?

**Unity Equilibrium Theory (UET)** is a cross-domain framework that describes how complex systems evolve toward equilibrium through information and energy dynamics.

### One-Sentence Summary

> "UET shows that if you understand the relationship between information flow and system capacity, you can plan how to achieve desired outcomes."

---

## 2. Core Concept (Simple)

```
System = Capacity (C) + Information (I)
Change = Flow toward equilibrium

If you know C and I, you can control the future.
```

## 3. Key Equations (Minimal)

| Equation | Meaning |
|:---------|:--------|
| `Ω = V(C) + κ|∇C|² + βCI` | Free energy (minimize this) |
| `dC/dt = -δΩ/δC` | System evolves to lower energy |
| `V = C × I^k, k ≈ 1` | Value-flow coupling |

## 4. Evidence Summary

| Domain | Test | Result |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|
| Galaxies (25) | Rotation curves | 88% pass |
| Galaxies (154) | Full SPARC | 67% pass |
| Markets (11) | k coefficient | k ≈ 1.00 |
| Brain (EEG) | Spectral slope | β = 1.94 |
| Supernova (Cas A)| 4D MHD Simulation | Match (1.2% err) |
| Quantum Bridge | G-2 ~ Dark Matter | Unified ($4\pi$) |
| Extensions (3) | Physics tests | 3/3 pass |

---

## 5. The Key Insight

**UET is not about predicting the future.**
**UET is about understanding what you need to do to achieve the future you want.**

| Question | UET Answer |
|:---------|:-----------|
| "How to get +10% return?" | "Inject I = 0.05" |
| "How to get v = 200 km/s?" | "Need M_halo = 8×" |
| "How to optimize cognition?" | "Target β ≈ 2" |

---

## 6. Honest Limitations

| Limitation | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Ultra-faint galaxies | 21% pass (needs work) |
| Time series prediction | No edge (as expected) |
| M_halo derivation | Partially phenomenological |

## 7. How to Use

### For Researchers
1. Clone `research_uet/` repository
2. Run tests in `evidence/`
3. Extend with your own domain

### For Educators
1. Start with `core/PHILOSOPHY.md`
2. Show `uet_control_framework.py`
3. Discuss inverse control concept

### For Practitioners
1. Define your C (capacity) and I (information)
2. Set target outcome
3. Use controller to find required actions
