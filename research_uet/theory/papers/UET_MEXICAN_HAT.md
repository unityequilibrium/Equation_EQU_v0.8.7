## Abstract

We demonstrate that UET naturally contains Higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breaking. Using a Mexican Hat potential, we observe:
- Goldstone mode (massless angular fluctuations)
- Higgs-like mode (massive radial fluctuations)

This suggests UET provides a mechanism for mass generation.

## 1. The Mexican Hat Potential

### 1.1 Definition

```
V(φ) = -μ²|φ|² + λ|φ|⁴
```

With complex field φ = φ_r + iφ_θ

### 1.2 VEV (Vacuum Expectation Value)

```
|φ|_VEV = √(μ²/2λ) = v
```

For our test: v ≈ 0.707

## 2. UET Dynamics

### 2.1 Equation of Motion

From UET:
```
∂φ/∂t = -δΩ/δφ* = μ²φ - 2λ|φ|²φ + κ∇²φ
```

### 2.2 Equilibrium

The system evolves to minimize Ω, settling at |φ| = v.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Dynamics

| Time | Energy | |φ| | θ |
|:-----|:-------|:----|:---|
| 0 | -0.0001 | 0.012 | -0.05 |
| 100 | -0.0015 | 0.042 | -0.00 |
| 200 | -0.0316 | 0.209 | -0.01 |
| 400 | -0.1094 | 0.480 | -0.02 |

### 3.2 Goldstone Check

| Mode | Energy Change | Mass |
|:-----|:--------------|:-----|
| Radial | ΔE = -0.008 | **Massive** |
| Angular | ΔE = 0.000 | **Massless** ✅ |

---

## 4. Interpretation

### 4.1 Higgs Mechanism

UET naturally produces:
- **Higgs-like mode**: Radial fluctuations have mass
- **Goldstone mode**: Angular fluctuations are massless

### 4.2 Mass Generation

In the Standard Model, Goldstone bosons are "eaten" by gauge fields to give them mass.

In UET, this suggests:
- Information fields can acquire "mass"
- Symmetry breaking is spontaneous

---

## 5. Connection to UET

### 5.1 Information Interpretation

- φ = Information field
- |φ| = Information density
- θ = Information phase

### 5.2 Physical Meaning

Symmetry breaking in UET means:
- System chooses a particular information state
- Phase θ can vary freely (Goldstone)
- Density |φ| costs energy to change (Higgs)

---

## 6. Honest Limitations

| Limitation | Note |
|:-----------|:-----|
| 2D simulation only | No gauge fields |
| Numerical, not analytic | Approximate |
| No coupling to matter | Toy model |

---

## 7. Conclusion

UET with Mexican Hat potential demonstrates:
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking ✅
- Goldstone mode (massless) ✅
- Higgs-like mode (massive) ✅

This suggests UET contains a natural mechanism for mass generation.
