## 1. Lessons Learned (Patterns)

### 1.1 The "Concept of Theme" Shift
*   **Old Way:** Calling it "Philosophy" (Abstract).
*   **New Way:** Calling it "Concept of Theme" or "Thinking Principle" (Practical).
*   **Result:** clearer communication, focused on effects rather than truth claims.

### 1.2 "Inverse Control"
*   **Discovery:** UET is better at *inverse problems* (What input gets this output?) than forward prediction (What will happen?).
*   **Application:** Applied to Finance (Portfolio strategy) and Engineering (SNR simulation inputs).

## 2. Self-Contradiction Analysis (Audit)

**Status:** Resolved (v1.5)

| Contradiction | Resolution |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| **Determinism vs Free Will** | UET is probabilistic (Macro). Preparation > Prediction. |
| **Materialism vs Information** | Information is treated as physical (Landauer), removing the dualism. |
| **Micro vs Macro** | United via Geometric Bridge ($4\pi$ scaling). |

## 3. Future Proposals (Psychology & AI)

*   **Proposal A:** Test UET on Large Language Model (LLM) loss curves. Does $\beta$ predict convergence?
*   **Proposal B:** Social Dynamics. Model "Twitter Mobs" using the 4D Simulation code (replacing Particles with Users).
*   **Proposal C:** Cognitive Load. Measure 'C' (Mental Capacity) vs 'I' (Task Complexity) in human subjects.
