## ⚡ Spotlight: Plasma MHD

**Objective:** Apply UET's "Stability Analysis" to Nuclear Fusion reactors (Tokamaks).
*   **Hypothesis:** Plasma instabilities (ELMs) are just "Information Entropy" spikes.
*   **Goal:** Use UET to predict these spikes *before* they crash the plasma.
*   **Potential Impact:** Solving the stability problem in Fusion Energy.
