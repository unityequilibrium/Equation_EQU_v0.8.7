## Abstract

We formalize Unity Equilibrium Theory (UET) as a **supplemental Information Layer** that sits on top of existing physics. UET does not replace Newton, Einstein, or Quantum Mechanics. Instead, it adds a missing **Information term** to their equations, resolving anomalies (dark matter, hidden variables, etc.) without breaking established laws.

## 1. The "Layer" Architecture

Physics is not a single flat theory. It is a stack.

| Layer | Theory | Domain | Governing Quantity |
|:------|:-------|:-------|:-------------------|
| **Layer 3** | **UET** | **Information** | **Entropy / Bit (I)** |
| Layer 2 | Quantum | Particles | Probability ($\Psi$) |
| Layer 1 | Relativistic | Spacetime | Geometry ($g_{\mu\nu}$) |
| Layer 0 | Newtonian | Macroscopic | Mass/Force ($F$) |

**Key Insight:** UET operates at Layer 3. It "injects" values down into lower layers.

## 2. Connection to Newton (Gravity)

### 2.1 The Problem
Newton says: $F = GMm/r^2$.
Observation: Galaxies spin too fast. Mass ($m$) is missing.

### 2.2 The UET Fix (Information Mass)
UET adds an Information Mass term ($M_{info}$) derived from entropy.

```
M_{total} = M_{baryon} (Newton) + M_{info} (UET)
```

Where $M_{info} \propto \ln(N_{stars})$.

**Result:** Newton's law still works. We just input the *correct* total mass (Matter + Information).

## 3. Connection to Einstein (Relativity)

### 3.1 The Problem
Einstein assumes $c$ is a constant fundamental speed limit.
Question: *Why* is $c$ finite?

### 3.2 The UET Fix (Memory Kernel)
UET shows that any system with **memory** naturally develops a finite propagation speed ($C_{eff}$).

```
C_{eff} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{\tau_{memory}}}
```

**Result:** Relativity emerges from the finite processing speed of the information layer. UET provides the *mechanism* for $c$.

## 4. Connection to Quantum (Probability)

### 4.1 The Problem
QM says particles are probabilities ($\Psi$).
Question: What "waves" is $\Psi$ made of?

### 4.2 The UET Fix (Information VEV)
UET treats the wavefunction as an Information Field ($\phi$).
Mexican Hat dynamics create a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV).

```
|\phi|^2 \propto \text{Information Density}
```

**Result:** Quantum probability = Information density. The breakdown of coherence (wavefunction collapse) is a thermodynamic phase transition in the information layer.

## 5. Summary of Connections

| Standard Physics | + UET Supplement | = Result |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:---------|
| $F = ma$ | + $M_{halo}$ derived from Entropy | Galaxy Rotation Fixed |
| Spacetime Metric | + Memory ($\tau$) | Finite $c$ Explained |
| Wavefunction $\Psi$ | + Goldstone/Higgs mechanics | Mass Generation Explained |
| Thermodynamics | + Information ($I$) | Landauer Limit / Maxwell's Demon |

## 6. Conclusion

UET does not fight Newton or Einstein.
It **completes** them.

It provides the "missing variables" (Dark Matter, Finite Speed, Collapse) that standard theories treat as constants or anomalies.

**UET is the Information Layer of the Universe.**
