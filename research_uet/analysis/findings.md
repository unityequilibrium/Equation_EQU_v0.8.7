# 🔬 Analysis & Interpretation

> *What the evidence means*

## 🎯 Key Finding: k ≈ 1.0

**Observation:** Most global markets show k ≈ 1.0

**What this means:**
```
V ∝ (C/I)^k

When k = 1:
V ∝ C/I  (linear relationship)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Markets are efficient information processors
- Value scales linearly with information flow
- No "magic" multiplier or emergent nonlinearity

## ⚠️ Outliers Worth Investigating

### Oil (k = 0.59)
- **Why low?** Heavily regulated, OPEC controls, political factors
- **Implication:** High "friction" in information flow
- **Prediction:** Oil markets respond slowly to information

### EUR/USD (k = 1.93)
- **Why high?** Currency pairs are highly liquid
- **Implication:** "Super-fluid" behavior
- **Question:** Is k > 1 sustainable or a bubble sign?

## 🧠 Brain Connection

**Finding:** β ≈ 2.0 in EEG (matches Brownian motion)

**What this means:**
- Brain processes information as a random walk
- Optimal for exploration + memory
- Same mathematical structure as healthy markets

**Connection to k:**
- β ≈ 2 in frequency domain ↔ k ≈ 1 in value domain
- Both indicate "efficient" information processing

## ❓ Open Questions

### 1. Why k ≈ 1?
- Is this a universal law?
- Or just coincidence in our sample?
- Need more domains (biology, physics)

### 2. Does k predict crashes?
- k < 0.5 predicted Dot-Com ✅
- k < 0.5 partially predicted GFC ⚠️
- External shocks (COVID) not captured ❌

### 3. How to define Temperature (T)?
- Landauer needs T
- What is T for a market? For a galaxy?
- This is a foundational gap
