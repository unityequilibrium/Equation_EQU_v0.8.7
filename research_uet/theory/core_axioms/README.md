# 📐 Core Concepts

> *The foundation of UET — Unity through Interaction*

---

## 🎯 The Big Idea

**Systems achieve unity through interaction. Information has real physical effects.**

UET measures how systems:
- **Connect** (C) — Quality of interaction between groups
- **Process** (I) — Information with real physical effects
- **Balance** (Ω) — Seek equilibrium/unity
- **Limit** (κ) — Fundamental interaction speed → origin of c

## 🌐 The Core Principle

```
Groups interact → Information flows → Effects propagate → Unity emerges
```

**Not prediction. Not control. Understanding interaction patterns.**

## 📊 The Variables

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|
| **C** | Interaction | Quality of group connection |
| **I** | Information | Real physical effects (not abstract) |
| **Ω** | Unity State | Coherence of system |
| **κ** | Limit | Interaction speed → explains c |

---

## ⚖️ The Core Equation

```
Ω[C, I] = ∫ [V(C) + (κ/2)|∇C|² + β·C·I] dx
```

- System minimizes Ω (seeks unity)
- dΩ/dt ≤ 0 (equivalent to Second Law of Thermodynamics)
- This is **Cahn-Hilliard dynamics** — established physics

## 🔗 Connection to Physics

| Physics | UET Extension |
|:--------|:--------------|
| E = mc² | Information has energy: E = k_B T ln(2) per bit |
| Entropy increase | Unity/coherence emergence |
| Speed of light | Interaction limit from κ and memory |

**UET does NOT replace physics. It explains through interaction.**
