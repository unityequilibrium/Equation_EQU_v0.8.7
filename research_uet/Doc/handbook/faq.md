# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is UET?
A framework for understanding systems through information flow.
It works **alongside** physics, not instead of it.

### Does UET replace Newton/Einstein?
**No.** UET is a separate layer. Like how economics doesn't replace physics.

### Is UET proven?
**Partially.** Some predictions are validated (k≈1 in markets).
Others are still hypotheses.

## Technical

### What do C, I, V mean?
- **C** = Communication rate (bits/s)
- **I** = Insulation (resistance to flow)
- **V** = Value (stored useful information)

See `core/variables.md` for details.

### Why k ≈ 1?
We don't know yet. This is an open question.
It might be a universal property or just coincidence.

### Can I use UET for my research?
Yes! The framework is open. Apply it to your domain and test it.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Testing if "UET = Newton"
That's wrong. They're different layers.

### ✅ Testing if "UET works alongside Newton"
That's the right question.

### ❌ Expecting UET to predict everything
UET is specialized for information dynamics.

### ✅ Using UET where information matters
Markets, brains, networks, organizations.

*Ask questions. Test predictions. Be honest about failures.*
