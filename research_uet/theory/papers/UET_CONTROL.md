## Abstract

UET is not a prediction tool. It's a CONTROL framework.

Instead of asking "What will happen?", UET asks:
**"If I want X, what do I need to do?"**

This is the TRUE power of UET — actionable intelligence.

## 1. The Paradigm Shift

### 1.1 Traditional Science

```
Given: Current state
Predict: Future state (impossible for complex systems)
```

### 1.2 UET Approach

```
Given: Desired outcome
Find: Required actions/parameters
```

---

## 2. The Mathematics

### 2.1 Forward Problem

```
dC/dt = -δΩ/δC
C(t+dt) = C(t) + dt × f(C, I)
```

### 2.2 Inverse Problem

Given C_target:
```
Required μ = (C_target - C_current) / dt
Required I = (μ - dV/dC) / β
```

---

## 3. Example: Finance

### 3.1 Question

"I want +10% return. What do I need?"

### 3.2 Calculation

```python
C_current = 0.0  # Equilibrium
C_target = 0.1   # +10%

Required I = 0.05  # Information injection
```

### 3.3 Interpretation

To achieve +10%:
- Inject positive information (I = 0.05)
- Actions: Buy pressure, positive news, capital inflow

---

## 4. Trajectory Planning

### 4.1 10 Steps to +10%

| Step | Required I |
|:-----|:-----------|
| 1 | 0.005 |
| 2 | 0.010 |
| 3 | 0.015 |
| ... | ... |
| 10 | 0.050 |
| **Total** | **0.274** |

### 4.2 Interpretation

Consistent, gradual information injection leads to target.

---

## 5. Reverse Analysis

### 5.1 Question

"Stock dropped 20%. What happened?"

### 5.2 Answer

```
Required I = -0.10 (negative)
```

Interpretation:
- Large negative information injection
- Massive sell pressure
- Capital flight

---

## 6. Applications

| Domain | Question | UET Answer |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------|
| Finance | "+10% return?" | "Inject I = 0.05" |
| Galaxy | "v = 200 km/s?" | "M_halo = 8× M_disk" |
| Brain | "Optimal cognition?" | "β ≈ 2" |

---

## 7. Why This Matters

### 7.1 Actionable

Prediction: "Stock will go up" (useless)
Control: "To go up 10%, inject I = 0.05" (actionable)

### 7.2 Honest

We don't claim to know the future.
We tell you what to do to shape it.

---

## 8. Honest Limitations

| Limitation | Note |
|:-----------|:-----|
| Requires target | Must know what you want |
| Simplified model | Real systems more complex |
| No guarantee | Actions may not achieve target |

---

## 9. Conclusion

**UET = Control, not Prediction**

> "The future is not predicted. It is created."
