## 1. The 4 Axioms (Foundational Principles)

These are the non-negotiable starting points of the framework.

| # | Axiom | Principle | Physical Basis |
|:--|:------|:----------|:---------------|
| **1** | **Information is Physical** | Every bit has energy cost | Landauer (1961): $E = k_B T \ln(2)$ |
| **2** | **Systems Have Boundaries** | Defined by separation | Flow rate $C$ across boundary $I$ |
| **3** | **Flow Seeks Balance** | Dynamics minimize potential | $dS/dt \ge 0$ (Second Law) |
| **4** | **Health Shows in Rhythm** | Dead systems are flat | Oscillation ($\omega$) indicates life |

## 2. Variables Reference

Detailed definitions of the cross-domain variables used in UET.

### 2.1 C — Interaction Quality (Capacity)
*   **Definition:** How well groups interact and communicate.
*   **Physical Meaning:** The "bandwidth" or "mass" (observable).
*   **Examples:** Mass (Physics), Liquidity (Finance), Connection (Brain).

### 2.2 I — Information (Hidden)
*   **Definition:** Information with **real physical effects**.
*   **Physical Meaning:** The "resistance" or "cost".
*   **Examples:** Dark Matter (Physics), Uncertainty (Finance), Entropy (Brain).

### 2.3 κ — Interaction Limit
*   **Definition:** The fundamental limit of propagation speed.
*   **Insight:** Explains the speed of light: $c_{eff} \approx \sqrt{\kappa / \tau_{memory}}$.

### 2.4 Ω — Unity State (Free Energy)
*   **Definition:** The coherence state of the system.
*   **Goal:** Systems naturally minimize Ω (move towards unity).

## 3. Key Concepts

### 3.1 Effective Temperature ($T_{eff}$)
In macro systems (where thermodynamic T doesn't apply), we use **Effective Temperature**:
$$ T_{eff} = \frac{\text{Variance of Observable}}{k_B} $$
*   **Markets:** Volatility (VIX)
*   **Brain:** Neural firing variance
*   **Galaxy:** Virial movement of stars

### 3.2 Why k ≈ 1?
Observation: In liquid markets and stable systems, the scaling exponent $k$ is often $\approx 1.0$.
*   **Reason 1 (Efficiency):** Value ($V$) perfectly tracks Information Flow ($C/I$) without lag to avoid arbitrage.
*   **Reason 2 (Stability):** $k=1$ is the point of maximum entropy production (optimal flow).

### 3.3 The "Dark Matter" Derivation ($M_{halo}$)
UET derives Dark Matter not as a particle, but as a thermodynamic necessity of low-density regions:
$$ \frac{M_{halo}}{M_{disk}} = \frac{k}{\sqrt{\rho}} $$
*   **Meaning:** When baryonic density ($\rho$) drops, the "vacuum information pressure" dominates, creating an effective mass (Dark Matter).
